# PetStorePractical
The repo contains a simple test suite written in Java to test the PetStore api as part of a Technical test.

# Current state
CreatePet.class can be run via command line using the following command: java CreatePet. This test is currently incomplete. The call to the petstore api is not working.

GetPet.class can be run via command line using the following command: Java -ea getPet <petId> which will return a Json response containing the details of the pet. An assertion has been added to assert that the petId is correct. Further assertions required.
